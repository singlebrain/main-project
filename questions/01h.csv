"In a packet switching network, packets are routed from source to destination along a single path having two intermediate nodes. If the message size is 24 bytes and each packet contains a header of 3 bytes, then the optimum packet size is:",4,6,7,9,d
The address resolution protocol (ARP) is used for,Finding the IP address from the DNS,Finding the IP address of the default gateway,Finding the IP address that corresponds to a MAC address,Finding the MAC address that corresponds to an IP address,d
Which of the following assertions is FALSE about the Internet Protocol (IP) ?,It is possible for a computer to have multiple IP addresses,IP packets from the same source to the same destination can take different routes in the network,IP ensures that a packet is discarded if it is unable to reach its destination within a given number of hops,The packet source cannot set the route of an outgoing packets; the route is determined only by the routing tables in the routers on the way,d
Routers forward a packet using forwarding table entries. The network address of incoming packet may match multiple entries. How routers resolve this?,Forward it the the router whose entry matches with the longest prefix of incoming packet,Forward the packet to all routers whose network addresses match,Discard the packet,Forward it the the router whose entry matches with the longest suffix of incoming packet,a

An IP datagram of size 1000 bytes arrives at a router. The router has to forward this packet on a link whose MTU (maximum transmission unit) is 100 bytes. Assume that the size of the IP header is 20 bytes. The number of fragments that the IP datagram will be divided into for transmission is :   Note : This question was asked as Numerical Answer Type.,10,50,12,13,d
