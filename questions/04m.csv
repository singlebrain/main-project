Assume that the SLR parser for a grammar G has n1 states and the LALR parser for G has n2 states. The relationship between n1 and n2 is:,n1 is necessarily less than n2,n1 is necessarily equal to n2,n1 is necessarily greater than n2,none of these,b
"In a bottom-up evaluation of a syntax directed definition, inherited attributes can",always be evaluated,be evaluated only if the definition is L-­attributed,be evaluated only if the definition has synthesized attributes,never be evaluated,b
