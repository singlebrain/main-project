"In an IPv4 datagram, the M bit is 0, the value of HLEN is 10, the value of total length is 400 and the fragment offset value is 300. The position of the datagram, the sequence numbers of the first and the last bytes of the payload, respectively are","Last fragment, 2400 and 2789","First fragment, 2400 and 2759","Last fragment, 2400 and 2759","Middle fragment, 300 and 689",c
"Consider the same data as given in previous question. After the update in the previous question, the link N1-N2 goes down. N2 will reflect this change immediately in its distance vector as cost, infinite. After the NEXT ROUND of update, what will be cost to N1 in the distance vector of N3?",3,9,10,infinite,c
One of the header fields in an IP datagram is the Time to Live(TTL)field.Which of the following statements best explains the need for this field?,It can be used to prioritize packets,It can be used to reduce delays,It can be used to optimize throughput,It can be used to prevent packet looping,d
Consider the data given in above question. Suppose the weights of all unused links in the previous question are changed to 2 and the distance vector algorithm is used again until all routing tables stabilize. How many links will now remain unused?,0,1,2,3,b
For which one of the following reasons does Internet Protocol (IP) use the timeto- live (TTL) field in the IP datagram header,Ensure packets reach destination within that time,Discard packets that reach later than that time,Prevent packets from looping indefinitely,Limit the time for which a packet gets queued in intermediate routers.,c
Which one of the following is TRUE about interior Gateway routing protocols - Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF),RIP uses distance vector routing and OSPF uses link state routing,OSPF uses distance vector routing and RIP uses link state routing,Both RIP and OSPF use link state routing,Both RIP and OSPF use distance vector routing,a
Every host in an IPv4 network has a 1-second resolution real-time clock with battery backup. Each host needs to generate up to 1000 unique identifiers per second. Assume that each host has a globally unique IPv4 address. Design a 50-bit globally unique ID for this purpose. After what period (in seconds) will the identifiers generated by a host wrap around?,128,64,256,512,c
An IP router with a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of 1500 bytes has received an IP packet of size 4404 bytes with an IP header of length 20 bytes. The values of the relevant fields in the header of the third IP fragment generated by the router for this packet are,"MF bit: 0, Datagram Length: 1444; Offset: 370","MF bit: 1, Datagram Length: 1424; Offset: 185","MF bit: 1, Datagram Length: 1500; Offset: 37","MF bit: 0, Datagram Length: 1424; Offset: 2960",a
Two computers C1 and C2 are configured as follows. C1 has IP address 203.197.2.53 and netmask 255.255.128.0. C2 has IP address 203.197.75.201 and netmask 255.255.192.0. which one of the following statements is true?,C1 and C2 both assume they are on the same network,"C2 assumes C1 is on same network, but C1 assumes C2 is on a different network","C1 assumes C2 is on same network, but C2 assumes C1 is on a different network",C1 and C2 both assume they are on different networks,c
"station A needs to send a message consisting of 9 packets to Station B using a sliding window (window size 3) and go-back-n error control strategy. All packets are ready and immediately available for transmission. If every 5th packet that A transmits gets lost (but no acks from B ever get lost), then what is the number of packets that A will transmit for sending the message to B?",12,14,16,18,c
