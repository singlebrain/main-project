"A single tape Turing Machine M has two states q0 and q1, of which q0 is the starting state. The tape alphabet of M is {0, 1, B} and its input alphabet is {0, 1}. The symbol B is the blank symbol used to indicate end of an input string. The transition function of M is described in the following table
 0  1  B
 q0  q1, 1, R  q1, 1, R  Halt
 q1  q1, 1, R  q0, 1, L  q0, B, L   The table is interpreted as illustrated below. The entry (q1, 1, R) in row q0 and column 1 signifies that if M is in state q0 and reads 1 on the current tape square, then it writes 1 on the same tape square, moves its tape head one position to the right and transitions to state q1. Which of the following statements is true about M ?",M does not halt on any string in (0 + 1)+,M does not halt on any string in (00 + 1)*,M halts on all string ending in a 0,M halts on all string ending in a 1,a
"Define languages L0 and L1 as follows :

"Consider the pushdown automaton (PDA) below which runs over the input alphabet (a, b, c). It has the stack alphabet {Z0, X} where Z0 is the bottom-of-stack marker. The set of states of the PDA is (s, t, u, f} where s is the start state and f is the final state. The PDA accepts by final state. The transitions of the PDA given below are depicted in a standard manner. For example, the transition (s, b, X) ? (t, XZ0) means that if the PDA is in state s and the symbol on the top of the stack is X, then it can read b from the input and move to state t after popping the top of stack and pushing the symbols Z0 and X (in that order) on the stack.
