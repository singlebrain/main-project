For a sentence n + n × n, the handles in the right-sentential form of the reduction are","n, E + n and E + n × n","n, E + n and E + E × n","n, n + n and n + n × n","n, E + n and E × n",d
"Consider the grammar
S ? (S) | a
Let the number of states in SLR(1), LR(1) and LALR(1) parsers for the grammar be n1, n2 and n3 respectively. The following relationship holds good",n1 < n2 < n3,n1 = n3 < n2,n1 = n2 = n3,n1 ? n3 ? n2,b

Here, gen is a function that generates the output code, and newtemp is a function that returns the name of a new temporary variable on every call. Assume that ti's are the temporary variable names generated by newtemp.
